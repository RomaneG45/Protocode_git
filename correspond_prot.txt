[["protocol post operative care heart surgery","POST OPERATIVE CARE PROTOCOL HEART SURGERY : \nSTEPS: \n1. Immediate Post-Operative Care Patient Identification and Initial Assessment Verify patient \nidentity using two identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth). Perform a full assessment upon \narrival in the recovery room or ICU, including vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, \nrespiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation). Monitoring and Vital Signs Monitor vital \nsigns every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes for the next two hours, and \nhourly thereafter if stable. Continuously monitor ECG for cardiac rhythm and rate. Monitor \noxygen saturation continuously using a pulse oximeter. Pain Management Assess pain using \nan appropriate pain scale (e.g., Numeric Rating Scale). Administer prescribed analgesics \n(e.g., IV opioids, non-opioid analgesics) and document the effectiveness. Implement non-\npharmacological pain relief methods (e.g., positioning, relaxation techniques). \n2. Respiratory Care Airway Management Ensure patency of the airway; suction as needed. If \nintubated, monitor ventilator settings and alarms. Oxygen Therapy Administer oxygen as \nprescribed to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%. Respiratory Exercises Encourage deep \nbreathing exercises and use of incentive spirometry every 1-2 hours while awake to prevent \natelectasis. \n3. Cardiovascular Care Hemodynamic Monitoring Continuously monitor ECG for arrhythmias and \nischemic changes. Monitor central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery pressure (if a \npulmonary artery catheter is in place), and arterial blood pressure. Fluid Management \nAdminister IV fluids as prescribed to maintain hemodynamic stability. Monitor intake and \noutput hourly, including urine output via Foley catheter. Medications Administer cardiac \nmedications as prescribed, including antiarrhythmics, inotropes, and vasopressors. Monitor \nand adjust anticoagulants as prescribed, checking INR\/PTT as needed. \n4. Wound Care Surgical Site Monitoring Inspect the surgical site for signs of infection, bleeding, \nor dehiscence. Maintain a sterile dressing over the surgical site and change it as prescribed or \nwhen soiled. Drain Management Monitor and document the output from chest tubes and other \nsurgical drains. Ensure chest tubes are patent and functioning properly; notify the provider of \nexcessive drainage or air leaks. \n5. Neurological Care Neurological Assessment Perform regular neurological assessments, \nincluding level of consciousness, pupil response, and motor\/sensory function. Report any \nchanges in neurological status immediately. \n6. Gastrointestinal and Nutritional Care Gastrointestinal Assessment Monitor for return of bowel \nsounds and flatus. Manage nausea and vomiting with prescribed medications. Nutritional \nSupport Begin with clear liquids as tolerated, progressing to a heart-healthy diet. Provide \nnutritional supplements as prescribed. \n7. Renal and Electrolyte Management Fluid Balance Monitor fluid intake and output meticulously. \nAssess for signs of fluid overload or deficit. Electrolyte Monitoring Regularly check electrolytes \nand correct imbalances as prescribed. \n8. Mobility and Activity Early Mobilization Encourage and assist with gradual mobilization as \nsoon as the patient is stable, starting with sitting up in bed and progressing to walking. Use \ncompression devices or stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Activity Restrictions \nEducate the patient on activity restrictions and gradually increase activity levels as tolerated \nand prescribed. \n9. Patient Education and Discharge Planning Patient and Family Education Educate the patient \nand family about post-operative care, medication regimen, signs of complications, and activity \nrestrictions. Provide written materials and resources for home care. Follow-Up Care Schedule \nfollow-up appointments with the surgeon and cardiologist. Arrange for home health care \nservices if necessary."]]
