[["Wound care","Wound Care Protocol\r\n1. Initial Assessment\r\nPatient Identification\r\n\r\nVerify patient identity using two identifiers (e.g., name and date of birth).\r\nMedical History Review\r\n\r\nReview patient\u0092s medical history, including allergies, medications, and past medical conditions that may affect wound healing (e.g., diabetes, vascular diseases).\r\nWound Assessment\r\n\r\nLocation: Document the anatomical location of the wound.\r\nSize: Measure the length, width, and depth of the wound.\r\nType: Identify the type of wound (e.g., surgical, pressure ulcer, laceration).\r\nAppearance: Note the color, presence of necrotic tissue, granulation tissue, and exudate.\r\nOdor: Assess for any unusual odor that may indicate infection.\r\nSurrounding Skin: Inspect the skin around the wound for redness, swelling, or other signs of infection.\r\n2. Cleaning the Wound\r\nHand Hygiene\r\n\r\nPerform hand hygiene before and after wound care using soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\r\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\r\n\r\nWear appropriate PPE (e.g., gloves, gown, mask) to protect against exposure to blood and body fluids.\r\nRemove Old Dressing\r\n\r\nCarefully remove the old dressing and dispose of it in a biohazard container.\r\nInspect the dressing for any signs of infection (e.g., increased exudate, odor).\r\nClean the Wound\r\n\r\nUse sterile saline or an appropriate wound cleanser to irrigate the wound gently.\r\nAvoid using harsh antiseptics unless specifically ordered by a healthcare provider.\r\n3. Debridement (if necessary)\r\nTypes of Debridement\r\n\r\nAutolytic: Using dressings that maintain a moist environment.\r\nEnzymatic: Applying topical agents that break down necrotic tissue.\r\nMechanical: Using tools (e.g., gauze) to remove dead tissue.\r\nSurgical: Performed by a healthcare provider.\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nFollow the specific method of debridement as ordered by the healthcare provider.\r\nEnsure pain management is provided if necessary.\r\n4. Dressing the Wound\r\nSelect Dressing Type\r\n\r\nChoose the appropriate dressing based on the wound type, exudate level, and healthcare provider\u0092s orders (e.g., hydrocolloid, foam, alginate).\r\nApplication\r\n\r\nApply a sterile dressing to cover the wound.\r\nSecure the dressing with tape or a secondary dressing as needed.\r\nEnsure the dressing provides a moist wound environment but does not macerate the surrounding skin.\r\n5. Documentation\r\nRecord Keeping\r\nDocument the date and time of wound care.\r\nNote the wound assessment findings, including size, appearance, and any changes.\r\nRecord the type of dressing applied and any patient responses or complaints.\r\n6. Patient Education\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\nEducate the patient on wound care at home if applicable.\r\nProvide instructions on signs of infection and when to seek medical attention.\r\nAdvise on the importance of nutrition and hydration for wound healing.\r\nFollow-up\r\n\r\nSchedule follow-up appointments as needed for ongoing wound assessment and care.\r\n7. Infection Control\r\nSigns of Infection\r\n\r\nMonitor for increased redness, swelling, warmth, pain, or purulent discharge.\r\nReport any signs of systemic infection (e.g., fever, malaise) to the healthcare provider immediately.\r\nAntibiotic Therapy\r\n\r\nAdminister antibiotics as prescribed and monitor for effectiveness and adverse reactions.\r\n8. Pain Management\r\nAssessment\r\n\r\nAssess the patient\u0092s pain level before, during, and after wound care.\r\nInterventions\r\n\r\nAdminister pain medication as prescribed.\r\nUtilize non-pharmacological pain relief methods (e.g., relaxation techniques)."],["Wound care","Example of wound"]]
